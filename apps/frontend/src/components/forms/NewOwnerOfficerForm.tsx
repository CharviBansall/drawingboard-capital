          To <strong>remove</strong> or change the information for an existing

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The entity licensed as the RIA (e.g., Common Financial Inc.) is not an
          "owner" of itself, so typically it will just be one or more individual{' '}
          <strong>direct owners</strong>, <strong>officers</strong>, and{' '}
          <strong>management persons</strong> of the RIA listed on Schedule A.
          This situation is reflected in Option 1 below.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Some RIAs have trusts, holding companies, or other entities as direct
          owners, in which case both the direct owner (Schedule A) and the{' '}
          <strong>indirect owners</strong> (Schedule B), meaning the individual
          owners of that direct owner, must be disclosed. This situation is
          reflected in Option 2 below.{' '}
          <strong>
            Please note that you will have to complete Option 1 for the direct
            owner(s) and then return to this page and complete Option 2 for the
            indirect owner(s).
